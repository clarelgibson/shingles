# Shingles

A data analysis project into shingles prevalence and its connection with the chickenpox vaccine.

## Analysis question

Is shingles less prevalent in countries that routinely immunize children against chickenpox?

## Blog post

My [blog post](https://www.surreydatagirl.com/blog) describes the reasons for conducting this analysis and the outcomes of the analysis.

## RMarkdown notebook

My [notebook](./shingles.Rmd) (also published on RPubs) details the technical methods employed to determine the data requirements and to gather, wrangle, analyse and present the data to answer the analysis question.
